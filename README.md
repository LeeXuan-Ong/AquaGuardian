# Aqua Guardian App - A Water Quality Monitoring System

## Project Description
 
Aqua Guardian is an innovative mobile application aimed to measure, record, and analyze if the water is drinkable or not depending on various factors such as ph,total dissolved solids and turbidity.The system is developed using cloud infrastructure and IoT technologies for real-time monitoring and data analysis.It provides users with the ability to track water purity levels.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring** : Continuous measurement of water quality parameters.
- **Data Collection** : Automated collection of sensor data while the device being used.
- **Data Storage** : Efficient storage mechanism using MySQl.
- **Data Analysis** : Tools for analyzing trends and detecting anomalies in water quality.
- **Warning System** : Warning Symbols for abnormal water quality conditions.
- **User Account Management**: Secure login and registration functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Mobile Development**: Developed using Kotlin for a native Android experience.
- **Backend Server**: AWS EC2 instances hosting a Flask application.
- **Database Management**: SQLAlchemy for database operations.
- **Real-Time Communication**: PubNub for real-time data streaming.
- **Authentication**: Firebase for user authentication and data storage.
- **Threading**: Utilized for concurrent processing and smooth user experience.
- **DNS Management**: Route 53 for DNS management of the GoDaddy URL.

## Hardware Integration

The system integrates with the following hardware components:

- **GPS Module**: For location tracking of the water sources.
- **TDS Sensor**: To measure the total dissolved solids in the water.
- **Turbidity Sensor**: To assess the clarity of the water.
- **pH Sensor**: To determine the acidity or basicity of the water.

- **Jakub Lowis** - Sensor Integration Specialist
- **Raveena Rathnam** - Backend Developer
- **Kosy Stephanie Ike-Ogoke** - Frontend Developer
- **Nojus Matusevicius** - Frontend Developer

## Feature Improvement and Future Functionalities

- **Machine Learning**: Implement ML algorithms for predictive analysis of water quality.
- **User Reporting Feature**: Allow users to report water issues directly through the app.
- **Community Engagement**: Integrate a forum for community discussions on water-related topics.

## What We Plan to Do

This project aims to expand its reach by incorporating more sensors, improving the accuracy of water quality measurement, and providing a community-driven platform for awareness and education on water safety.
