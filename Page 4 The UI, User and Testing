From Sofia, Bulgaria 
Education – Degree in creative media from the College of Paris 
Motivation she is a hypochondriac, and her area has had some previous reports of contamination in the tap water 

Goals and needs  
Silvia is conducting the test to see if she can drink from her tap because she is afraid that it is going to be contaminated again like it was 4 months ago. 
Her English is not the best, so it needs to be easy for her to understand if it is clean or not 

Scenario  
Silvia has poured some of her tap water into a cup and has placed her sensors into the water and waits a couple of seconds before she opens the Aqua Gaudian app she sees a notification pop up she doesn't understand what it means.
She clicks the notification, and it brings her to a screen on the app where there is a red dot and next to it says Домашна чешмяна вода 
This is still the same device she had set up 4 months ago when her estate's water got contaminated. She sees the dot which is normally green now red with a universal warning sign beside it.

Philipe Phobos age 19 
From Coruna,Spain 
Education Has just graduated from secondary school

of his water at home to see if he could benefit from drinking more of his own tap water rather than going out and spending money on zinc tablets 

Goals and needs  
His goal is to see what the zinc content of his drinking water is because he would like to follow the doctors instructions and get more zinc into his body  

Scenario
